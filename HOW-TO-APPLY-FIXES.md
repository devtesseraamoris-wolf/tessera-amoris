# How to Apply Fixes to Your Local Repository

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: You Need to Download the Fixed Files

The fixes I made are in the **sandbox environment**, not in your local repository. You need to download and apply them.

---

## üì• Step 1: Download the Fixed ZIP File

I provided a ZIP file attachment: **tessera-amoris-fixed-v2.0.zip**

Download this file from the chat attachments.

---

## üîß Step 2: Apply Fixes to Your Local Repository

### Option A: Replace Specific Files (Recommended)

Extract the ZIP and copy **only these modified files** to your local repository:

```
C:\Users\black\Desktop\Projects\Tessera\Dennis\Web\v2\tessera_amoris_production_vercel\tessera_production\
```

**Files to copy**:

1. **application.html** (modified - cache-busting added)
2. **js/paraguay-europe-selector.js** (modified - logging added)
3. **js/expansion-modal-handler.js** (modified - logging added)
4. **css/mobile-responsive-enhanced-v2.css** (NEW FILE)
5. **verify-countries.html** (NEW FILE)
6. **EXECUTIVE-SUMMARY.md** (NEW FILE)
7. **DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md** (NEW FILE)
8. **README-FIXES.md** (NEW FILE)
9. **ANALYSIS.md** (NEW FILE)
10. **TEST-VALIDATION-REPORT.md** (NEW FILE)

### Option B: Replace Entire Project (Easiest)

1. Backup your current project:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\black\Desktop\Projects\Tessera\Dennis\Web\v2\
   xcopy tessera_amoris_production_vercel tessera_amoris_backup /E /I
   ```

2. Extract the ZIP file to replace your project folder

3. Copy your `.git` folder from backup to the new folder

---

## üîç Step 3: Verify the Fixes Were Applied

Check if these changes exist in your local files:

### Check 1: application.html has cache-busting

Open `application.html` and search for `?v=2.0`

You should see:
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/styles.css?v=2.0">
<script src="js/paraguay-europe-selector.js?v=2.0"></script>
```

**Expected**: 35 occurrences of `?v=2.0`

### Check 2: paraguay-europe-selector.js has v2.0 flag

Open `js/paraguay-europe-selector.js` and check the first lines:

You should see:
```javascript
const SELECTOR_FLAG = 'paraguay-europe-v2.0';
```

### Check 3: New mobile CSS file exists

Check if this file exists:
```
css/mobile-responsive-enhanced-v2.css
```

File size should be around 25 KB (627 lines)

### Check 4: Console logging added

Open `js/paraguay-europe-selector.js` and search for `[Tessera]`

You should find multiple console.log statements like:
```javascript
console.log('[Tessera] Selector flag set:', SELECTOR_FLAG);
console.log('[Tessera] Paraguay-Europe Selector v2.0 initializing...');
```

## üöÄ Step 4: Commit and Push

After verifying the fixes are in your local files:

```bash
cd C:\Users\black\Desktop\Projects\Tessera\Dennis\Web\v2\tessera_amoris_production_vercel\tessera_production

# Check what changed
git status

# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Apply v2.0 fixes: country dropdown, mobile responsive, cache-busting"

# Pull remote changes first (to avoid conflicts)
git pull origin main

# Resolve conflicts if any, then push
git push origin main
```

---

## üß™ Step 5: Test Locally (Optional but Recommended)

Before deploying, test locally:

1. Open `application.html` in your browser
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Look for these logs:
   ```
   [Tessera] Selector flag set: paraguay-europe-v2.0
   [Tessera] Paraguay-Europe Selector v2.0 initializing...
   [Tessera] Available countries: 46
   ```
4. Click country dropdown - should show 46 countries only

---

## üåê Step 6: Deploy to Vercel

After pushing to GitHub:

1. **Vercel will auto-deploy** (if you have auto-deploy enabled)

2. **Clear Vercel CDN Cache**:
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Settings ‚Üí Advanced
   - Click "Purge Cache"

3. **Test in Production**:
   - Open your site in **incognito mode**
   - Hard refresh: `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac)
   - Open console (F12)
   - Look for `[Tessera]` logs
   - Test country dropdown

---

## ‚ùå Common Issues

### Issue: "Country dropdown doesn't open"

**Cause**: JavaScript error preventing initialization

**Fix**:
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Check if `paraguay-europe-selector.js?v=2.0` is loaded (Network tab)
4. Verify the file has the correct content

### Issue: "Still seeing old version"

**Cause**: Browser or CDN cache

**Fix**:
1. Clear Vercel CDN cache
2. Hard refresh in browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. Test in incognito mode
4. Clear browser cache completely

### Issue: "Git push rejected"

**Cause**: Remote has changes you don't have

**Fix**:
```bash
git pull origin main
# Resolve conflicts if any
git push origin main
```

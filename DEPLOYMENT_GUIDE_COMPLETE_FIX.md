## Database Setup

### Run Migration for Expansion Interests

The expansion modal requires a database table. Run this in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- This file already exists in the package: database-expansion-interests.sql
-- Copy and paste its contents into Supabase SQL Editor
```

**Steps:**
1. Go to your Supabase project
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Open `database-expansion-interests.sql` from the package
4. Copy the entire contents
5. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"

**What it creates:**
- `expansion_interests` table
- Analytics views
- Priority scoring functions

---

## Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_supabase_service_key
```

**To set in Vercel:**
1. Go to your project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add/verify both variables
4. Redeploy if needed

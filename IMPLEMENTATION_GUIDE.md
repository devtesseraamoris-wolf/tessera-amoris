## üìä Analytics & Monitoring

### Built-in Analytics

The system tracks:
- Quiz completion rate
- Score distribution
- Time spent on quiz
- Application quality by quiz score

### View Analytics in Supabase

**Quiz Score Distribution:**
```sql
SELECT 
    quiz_score,
    COUNT(*) as count,
    ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER(), 2) as percentage
FROM applications
WHERE quiz_score IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY quiz_score
ORDER BY quiz_score DESC;
```

**Category Performance:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM quiz_analytics;
```

**Recent Applications:**
```sql
SELECT 
    position,
    full_name,
    email,
    quiz_score,
    quiz_result_category,
    status,
    created_at
FROM waitlist_positions
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY position DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## üîß Customization Options

### Adjust Quiz Scoring Thresholds

Edit `js/pre-screening-quiz.js`, find the `showResults()` function:

```javascript
// Current thresholds:
if (score.percentage >= 87) {  // 13-15 points - Highly Aligned
if (score.percentage >= 60) {  // 9-12 points - Aligned
if (score.percentage >= 33) {  // 5-8 points - Reflection
// else: 0-4 points - Not Aligned

// To make MORE selective, increase thresholds:
if (score.percentage >= 93) {  // Only 14-15 points pass
if (score.percentage >= 73) {  // 11-15 points with reflection

// To make LESS selective, decrease thresholds:
if (score.percentage >= 80) {  // 12-15 points pass
if (score.percentage >= 53) {  // 8-15 points with reflection
```

### Modify Quiz Questions

Edit `js/pre-screening-quiz.js`, find the `quizQuestions` array:

```javascript
const quizQuestions = [
    {
        id: 1,
        question: "Your new question here?",
        options: [
            {
                letter: "A",
                text: "Best answer (aligned)",
                points: 3
            },
            {
                letter: "B",
                text: "Neutral answer",
                points: 1
            },
            {
                letter: "C",
                text: "Misaligned answer",
                points: 0
            }
        ]
    },
    // ... more questions
];
```

### Change Result Messages

Edit `js/pre-screening-quiz.js`, find the `showResults()` function and modify the `resultMessage` text for each category.

### Customize Waitlist Timeline

Edit `waitlist-confirmation.html`, find the `.timeline` section and modify the steps.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Quiz Doesn't Appear

**Check:**
1. Browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
2. Verify `pre-screening-quiz.js` is loaded
3. Check if `quiz-modal-overlay` element exists
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Add to browser console to debug:
console.log(document.getElementById('quiz-modal-overlay'));
console.log(window.TesseraQuiz);
```

### Position Number Shows "#---"

**Check:**
1. API response includes `position` field
2. URL has `?position=X` parameter
3. localStorage has `tesseraWaitlistPosition`

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
console.log(new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('position'));
console.log(localStorage.getItem('tesseraWaitlistPosition'));
```

### Quiz Data Not Saving to Database

**Check:**
1. Database migration ran successfully
2. API receives `quizData` in request
3. Supabase columns exist

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Verify columns exist:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'applications' AND column_name LIKE 'quiz%';
```

### Styling Issues

**Check:**
1. CSS files are loaded in correct order
2. No CSS conflicts with existing styles
3. Browser cache is cleared

**Fix:**
```html
<!-- Verify in page source: -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/pre-screening-quiz.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/waitlist-confirmation.css">
```

---

## üîê Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- No PII in quiz data
- GDPR compliant

### Rate Limiting
Consider adding rate limiting to prevent spam:

```javascript
// In api/submit-application.js
const submissionKey = `submission_${req.headers['x-forwarded-for']}`;
// Implement rate limiting logic
```

### Input Validation
All inputs validated on both client and server side.

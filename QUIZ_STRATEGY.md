## Research-Based Questions for High-Quality Filtering

---

## Research Foundation

### Target Audience Profile
- **Age Range:** 28-45 (established, marriage-ready)
- **Cultural Background:** Paraguay + Europe
- **Faith:** Christian (Catholic, Protestant, Lutheran, etc.)
- **Relationship Goal:** Marriage within 1-3 years
- **Values:** Family, faith, legacy, cross-cultural openness

### Red Flags to Filter Out
1. **Casual daters** - Not serious about marriage
2. **Cultural rigidity** - Won't embrace Paraguay-Europe connection
3. **Weak faith commitment** - Faith is peripheral, not central
4. **Unrealistic expectations** - Seeking perfection, not partnership
5. **Financial/emotional immaturity** - Not ready for serious commitment

## The 5 Strategic Questions

### Question 1: Faith Integration (Core Value Alignment)

**Question:**
> "How does faith shape your daily life and major decisions?"

**Options:**
- **A) [3 points - ALIGNED]** "Faith is the foundation of my life. I pray daily, attend services regularly, and seek divine guidance in all major decisions including relationships and career."

- **B) [1 point - NEUTRAL]** "Faith is important to me. I attend services occasionally and pray when facing challenges, but I also rely heavily on my own judgment."

- **C) [0 points - MISALIGNED]** "I respect faith and traditions, but I make decisions based primarily on logic, personal goals, and practical considerations."

**Why This Works:**
- Filters for **active** faith practice, not just cultural Christianity
- Distinguishes between "faith-informed" vs "faith-centered" individuals
- Aligns with Tessera Amoris core value: "God first"

### Question 2: Marriage Timeline & Commitment Level

**Question:**
> "What does your ideal timeline look like from meeting someone to marriage?"

**Options:**
- **A) [3 points - ALIGNED]** "6-18 months of intentional courtship focused on compatibility, family integration, and spiritual alignment. I'm ready to commit when I find the right person."

- **B) [1 point - NEUTRAL]** "2-3 years to really get to know someone through different life seasons. I believe in taking time to be absolutely certain before such a major commitment."

- **C) [0 points - MISALIGNED]** "I'm in no rush. I want to enjoy dating, travel together, and see how things naturally evolve over 3-5+ years before considering marriage."

**Why This Works:**
- Identifies **urgency** and **readiness** for marriage
- Filters out perpetual daters who aren't ready to commit
- Option A shows maturity: knows what they want, ready to act
- Option C reveals casual dating mindset

---

### Question 3: Cross-Cultural Relationship Readiness

**Question:**
> "A successful Paraguay-Europe relationship requires significant cultural adaptation. How do you view this?"

**Options:**
- **A) [3 points - ALIGNED]** "I'm genuinely excited about learning a new culture, potentially relocating, learning a new language, and integrating two families. Cultural differences enrich relationships when both partners are committed."

- **B) [1 point - NEUTRAL]** "I'm open to it, but I'd need my partner to adapt significantly to my culture and lifestyle. I'm willing to make some adjustments, but I have clear boundaries."

- **C) [0 points - MISALIGNED]** "I prefer someone from my own cultural background. While I respect other cultures, I believe relationships are easier when both partners share the same cultural context."

**Why This Works:**
- **Critical** for Paraguay-Europe matchmaking
- Option A shows genuine openness and sacrifice
- Option B reveals conditional openness (red flag)
- Option C filters out cultural rigidity immediately

---

### Question 4: Family Vision & Children

**Question:**
> "How do you envision your future family?"

**Options:**
- **A) [3 points - ALIGNED]** "I want 2-4 children raised in a faith-centered home where both parents are actively involved. Family dinners, regular worship, and strong extended family connections are essential to me."

- **B) [1 point - NEUTRAL]** "I'm open to 1-2 children if the relationship is right, but I also value maintaining our couple identity, careers, and personal freedom. Family is one important part of a fulfilling life."

- **C) [0 points - MISALIGNED]** "I'm undecided about children. I want to focus on my career and personal growth first. If children happen, great, but they're not a priority or requirement for my happiness."

**Why This Works:**
- Distinguishes **family-first** vs **career-first** mindsets
- Option A shows clear vision and commitment
- Option B reveals ambivalence (may not be ready)
- Option C filters out those not aligned with "legacy building"

---

### Question 5: Financial & Life Readiness

**Question:**
> "Which statement best describes your current life stage?"

**Options:**
- **A) [3 points - ALIGNED]** "I'm financially stable with a clear career path, emotionally mature from past experiences, and have a strong support system. I'm ready to build a life with the right partner."

- **B) [1 point - NEUTRAL]** "I'm working toward financial stability and still figuring out some aspects of my career and life direction. I'm open to growing together with a partner."

- **C) [0 points - MISALIGNED]** "I'm in a transition phase - changing careers, dealing with past relationship baggage, or working through personal challenges. I'm hoping a relationship will help me find direction."

**Why This Works:**
- Filters for **readiness** and **stability**
- Option A = established, ready to give
- Option B = still developing (may not be ready)
- Option C = seeking partner to "fix" them (major red flag)

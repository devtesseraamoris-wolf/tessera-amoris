# Tessera Amoris - Deployment Guide v2.0

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

### Issue #1: Country Dropdown (CRITICAL) ✅
**Problem**: Users reported seeing Brazil, Canada, USA, and other non-European countries in the dropdown.

**Root Cause**: Browser caching was showing old JavaScript files. The code was actually correct.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Added cache-busting version parameters (`?v=2.0`) to all CSS and JS files
2. ✅ Strengthened selector initialization with better conflict prevention
3. ✅ Added console logging for debugging
4. ✅ Created verification page to test country list
5. ✅ Confirmed RAW_COUNTRIES array contains exactly 46 countries (Paraguay + 45 Europe)

### Issue #2: Mobile Responsiveness (HIGH PRIORITY) ✅
**Problem**: Application form was not responsive on smartphones - horizontal scrolling, small text, non-touch-friendly buttons.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Created comprehensive mobile CSS (`mobile-responsive-enhanced-v2.css`)
2. ✅ Ensured all inputs are 16px minimum (prevents iOS zoom)
3. ✅ Made all buttons 48px minimum height (touch-friendly)
4. ✅ Stacked form fields vertically on mobile
5. ✅ Fixed iOS Safari specific issues
6. ✅ Added landscape mode support
7. ✅ Prevented horizontal scroll on all screen sizes

### Issue #3: Expansion Modal (MEDIUM PRIORITY) ✅
**Status**: Verified and enhanced.

**Solution Implemented**:
1. ✅ Confirmed modal HTML exists in application.html
2. ✅ Added console logging for debugging
3. ✅ Enhanced mobile responsiveness for modal
4. ✅ Verified "My country isn't listed yet" triggers modal

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Still seeing Brazil, Canada, USA in dropdown

**Cause**: Browser cache or CDN cache not cleared.

**Solution**:
1. Clear Vercel CDN cache (see Step 3 above)
2. Instruct users to hard refresh:
   - Windows/Linux: `Ctrl + Shift + R`
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. Test in incognito/private mode
4. Check browser console for version: should see `paraguay-europe-v2.0`

### Problem: Mobile still not responsive

**Cause**: CSS cache not cleared or viewport meta tag missing.

**Solution**:
1. Verify viewport meta tag in `application.html`:
   ```html
   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
   ```
2. Check if `mobile-responsive-enhanced-v2.css` is loaded:
   - Open browser dev tools → Network tab
   - Look for `mobile-responsive-enhanced-v2.css?v=2.0`
3. Clear cache and hard refresh

### Problem: Expansion modal not opening

**Cause**: JavaScript not loaded or event listener not attached.

**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `expansion-modal-handler.js?v=2.0` is loaded
3. Look for log: `[Tessera] Expansion Modal Handler v2.0 initializing...`
4. Check if modal HTML exists: `<div id="expansionModal">`

### Problem: Console shows old version

**Cause**: Service worker or aggressive caching.

**Solution**:
1. Open browser dev tools → Application tab
2. Clear storage (cookies, cache, service workers)
3. Hard refresh
4. Test in incognito mode

# Quick Start Testing Guide - Responsive Typography

**Project:** Tessera Amoris  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Purpose:** Verify responsive typography implementation

## What Changed?

A comprehensive responsive typography system has been implemented to optimize font-size readability across all devices. The system uses fluid scaling (clamp) to ensure text is perfectly sized on smartphones, tablets, and desktops.

## Quick Test Checklist

### ✅ Step 1: Open the Application Form

1. Open `application.html` in your browser
2. You should immediately notice clearer, more readable text
3. All text should appear professional and well-proportioned

### ✅ Step 2: Test on Different Screen Sizes

**Desktop (1440px+)**:
- Section titles should be large and commanding (40px)
- Body text should be comfortable to read (18px)
- Form inputs should be clearly visible (18px)
- Everything should feel spacious and elegant

**Tablet (768px)**:
- Text should scale down smoothly
- Still very readable and professional
- No awkward jumps in size
- Touch targets should be comfortable

**Mobile (375px)**:
- Text should be smallest but still readable
- Form inputs should be 16px minimum
- No automatic zoom when tapping inputs
- All text should be legible without zooming

### ✅ Step 3: Test Form Inputs (Critical!)

**On iPhone/iPad (Safari)**:
1. Tap any text input field
2. **Expected**: No automatic zoom should occur
3. **Why**: All inputs are now 16px minimum (prevents iOS zoom)
4. **Before**: Inputs were 14px and caused annoying auto-zoom

**On Android (Chrome)**:
1. Tap any text input field
2. Text should be clearly visible
3. Easy to type without zooming

### ✅ Step 4: Check Each Section

**Section 1: Your Vision**
- ✓ Section title is large and elegant
- ✓ Inspiration quote is prominent
- ✓ Textarea text is 16-18px (comfortable)
- ✓ Character counter is visible (13-15px)

**Section 2: About You**
- ✓ All input fields are consistent size
- ✓ Labels are clear (15-17px)
- ✓ Date picker is readable
- ✓ Location autocomplete is clear

**Section 3: Faith & Values**
- ✓ Value tags are readable (13-15px)
- ✓ Category titles stand out
- ✓ Descriptions are clear
- ✓ Easy to select options

**Section 4: Lifestyle & Goals**
- ✓ Radio button labels are clear
- ✓ Checkbox labels are readable
- ✓ All options are easy to see
- ✓ Descriptions are helpful

**Section 5: Final Steps**
- ✓ Photo card titles are prominent
- ✓ Instructions are clear
- ✓ Upload buttons are visible
- ✓ Pro tips are readable

**Section 6: Review**
- ✓ Review title is dramatic
- ✓ Category sections are clear
- ✓ Data labels and values are readable
- ✓ Easy to verify information

### ✅ Step 5: Test Responsive Scaling

**Using Browser DevTools**:
1. Open DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
2. Enable device toolbar (Cmd+Shift+M)
3. Test these widths:
   - 320px (iPhone SE)
   - 375px (iPhone standard)
   - 768px (iPad)
   - 1024px (iPad Pro)
   - 1440px (Desktop)
   - 1920px (Large desktop)

**What to Look For**:
- ✓ Text scales smoothly (no jumps)
- ✓ Proportions remain elegant
- ✓ Nothing breaks or overlaps
- ✓ Hierarchy is maintained

### ✅ Step 6: Accessibility Check

**Zoom Test**:
1. Use browser zoom (Cmd/Ctrl + Plus)
2. Zoom to 150%, then 200%
3. Text should scale proportionally
4. Layout should remain intact
5. No horizontal scrolling at 200%

**High Contrast Mode** (if available):
1. Enable system high contrast mode
2. Text should be bolder (font-weight 500)
3. Still readable and clear

**Font Size Preference**:
1. Change browser default font size to 20px
2. All text should scale up proportionally
3. Hierarchy should be maintained

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Text Looks the Same

**Cause**: Browser cache  
**Solution**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R or Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Issue: Some Text Didn't Change

**Cause**: CSS load order  
**Solution**: Verify `responsive-typography-system.css` is loaded last in `application.html` (line 55)

### Issue: iOS Still Zooms on Input

**Cause**: Browser cache or incorrect implementation  
**Solution**: 
1. Clear Safari cache
2. Verify input font-size is 16px in DevTools
3. Check for inline styles overriding CSS

### Issue: Text Too Large on Desktop

**Cause**: Expected behavior for better readability  
**Solution**: This is intentional. Desktop users benefit from larger text (18px vs 16px). If adjustment needed, modify CSS variables in `responsive-typography-system.css`
